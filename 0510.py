Project 510: Bankruptcy Prediction Model
Description:
Bankruptcy prediction is a critical task for financial institutions to identify firms at risk of defaulting on their obligations. In this project, we will use financial ratios such as debt-to-equity, liquidity ratios, and profitability indicators to predict the likelihood of a company going bankrupt. We will build a predictive model using Logistic Regression and evaluate its performance.

Python Implementation (Bankruptcy Prediction using Logistic Regression)
For real-world applications:

Use real financial data such as company balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements.

Enhance the model by incorporating machine learning models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting for better performance.

# 1. Simulate financial data (e.g., debt-to-equity, liquidity ratio, profitability)
np.random.seed(42)
data = {
    'debt_to_equity': np.random.normal(1.5, 0.5, 1000),  # Debt-to-equity ratio
    'current_ratio': np.random.normal(1.2, 0.3, 1000),  # Current ratio (liquidity ratio)
    'return_on_assets': np.random.normal(0.05, 0.02, 1000),  # Return on assets
    'interest_coverage': np.random.normal(3, 1.5, 1000),  # Interest coverage ratio
    'bankruptcy': np.random.choice([0, 1], 1000)  # 0 = Non-bankrupt, 1 = Bankrupt
}
 
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
 
# 2. Preprocessing
X = df.drop('bankruptcy', axis=1)
y = df['bankruptcy']
 
# 3. Scale the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
 
# 4. Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
 
# 5. Logistic Regression model to predict bankruptcy
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
 
# 6. Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
 
# 7. Evaluate the model
print("Bankruptcy Prediction Report:\n")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
 
# 8. Plot the feature importance (coefficients of the logistic regression)
coefficients = model.coef_[0]
features = X.columns
 
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(features, coefficients)
plt.title("Feature Importance in Bankruptcy Prediction")
plt.xlabel("Financial Ratios")
plt.ylabel("Coefficient Value")
plt.show()
 
# 9. Predict bankruptcy for a new company based on financial ratios
new_data = np.array([[2.0, 1.1, 0.04, 2]])  # Example: debt_to_equity=2.0, current_ratio=1.1, return_on_assets=4%, interest_coverage=2
new_data_scaled = scaler.transform(new_data)
predicted_bankruptcy = model.predict(new_data_scaled)
print(f"\nPredicted Bankruptcy: {'Yes' if predicted_bankruptcy[0] == 1 else 'No'}")
✅ What It Does:
Simulates financial data with features such as debt-to-equity ratio, liquidity ratio, return on assets, and interest coverage ratio.

Uses Logistic Regression to predict whether a company is at risk of bankruptcy (1) or not (0).

Evaluates the model with classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

Plots the feature importance to understand which financial ratios most influence bankruptcy predictions.

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Real-world data: Use actual financial data from companies, such as balance sheets and income statements, available through sources like Yahoo Finance or FRED.

Advanced models: Implement Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost to improve prediction accuracy.

Financial features: Add additional financial ratios like working capital, quick ratio, or operating margin to enhance the model’s performance.

Time-series data: Extend the model to handle time-series data for financial ratios over multiple periods, capturing trends in bankruptcy risk over time.
